# Tata GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation

## Your team

**Your team:**
- This team at Tata iQ specializes in leveraging data analytics and AI-powered insights to enhance decision-making in the financial sector.
- The team collaborates with business leaders and strategy teams across Tata’s financial services companies to develop predictive models, risk assessments, and AI-driven intervention strategies for optimizing business outcomes.
  
**Your role:**
- You are an AI transformation consultant at Tata iQ, specializing in data-driven decision-making for financial services.
- You work within a larger data analytics team, collaborating with business leaders to develop AI-powered solutions.
- Your team has been tasked with helping Geldium Finance, a financial services company, reduce its high credit card delinquency rate by performing advanced analytics and building AI/ML models with the assistance of GenAI.

**Your goal:**
- Your primary objective is to analyze customer data and predict delinquency risks using AI-driven techniques.
- You will develop a recommendation framework to help the Head of Collections at Geldium determine the best intervention strategies for at-risk customers.
- Throughout the project, you will ensure that AI-driven solutions are ethical, explainable, and effective in supporting responsible financial decision-making.

## Project Briefing 

**_Geldium_** - a financial services provider specializing in digital lending and consumer credit. The company has observed an increase in credit card delinquency rates, with more customers missing payments beyond the 30-day late payment threshold. To improve risk management and customer engagement, they have engaged Tata iQ to develop an AI-powered predictive solution that helps identify at-risk customers and recommend appropriate interventions.

The head of Geldium’s Collections team wants to improve how they assess repayment risk and prioritize outreach efforts. Currently, their approach relies on historical trends and manual case handling, which limits efficiency. They are looking for a solution that can:

- **Use AI-driven insights** to help predict which customers are likely to miss payments.
- **Support the Head of Collections with targeted intervention strategies** to reduce delinquency.
- **Ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven risk assessments** while aligning with industry practices.
 
As an **AI transformation consultant**, your task is to:

- **Review available customer data** to identify patterns and risk factors.
- **Develop a predictive model logic using GenAI** to forecast delinquency likelihood.
- **Provide structured recommendations** on intervention strategies.
- **Prepare a PowerPoint presentation** outlining how Geldium can implement an AI-powered collections system, including ethical guardrails and expected business impact.

## Project Tasks

**Task 1: Exploratory data analysis and risk profiling**

**EDA**: 
  - Understanding the dataset
  - Identifying missing values and outliers
  - Understanding relationships between variables
  - Detecting paterns and risk factors

**Handle missing values and ensure data quality**: 
  - Deleting missing data
  - Imputation (replacing missing data)
  - AI-assisted Imputation

Lenders assess various financial and behavioral indicators to determine whether a customer is likely to miss payments. By analyzing these factors, Geldium’s Collections team can proactively identify customers who may need early intervention, reducing financial losses and improving repayment outcomes.

**Key risk factors for delinquency**:  
  - **_Payment history_** – Customers with a history of late or missed payments are more likely to default.
  - **_Credit utilization rate_** – High usage of available credit can indicate financial stress and potential repayment issues.
  - **_Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio_** – A high DTI suggests a customer may struggle to manage their financial obligations.
  - **_Recent credit activity_** – A sudden increase in new credit accounts or loan applications may signal financial instability.
  - **_Employment and income stability_** – Frequent job changes or inconsistent income can contribute to a higher risk of missed payments.
  - **_Demographic trends_** – While AI models must avoid bias, certain patterns (e.g., younger customers with limited credit history) may require additional analysis.

**Ethical considerations**:

  While synthetic data can enhance dataset completeness, it must be used carefully to avoid:
  - **_Introducing bias_** – Ensure synthetic records reflect realistic patterns.
  - **_Misrepresenting risk factors_** – Avoid generating overly optimistic or pessimistic data.
  - **_Compromising compliance_** – Validate that synthetic data aligns with industry regulations.

**Task 2: Predicting delinquency with AI**

Geldium wants to use AI to predict which customers are at risk of missing payments so they can take proactive steps to reduce delinquency. Our goal is to develop a model that supports the Collections team in prioritizing outreach and intervention strategies.
- Use **GenAI tools** to develop a **predictive model** for identifying high-risk customers.
- Choose and **justify the best approach**—whether decision trees, logistic regression, or another technique.
- Define a plan to **evaluate model performance** while ensuring fairness and explainability.

Common techniques for credit risk modeling: 
- Use **decision trees** if you need transparency and clear risk segmentation.
- Use **logistic regression** if you need a probability-based approach that is easy to interpret.
- Use **neural networks** if you have a complex dataset and need high accuracy at the cost of explainability.

Completing a Model Plan Report: 
- Generate model logic using GenAI.
- Justify your model choice.
- Plan how to evaluate model performance.

**Task 3: Business report and data storytelling for collections strategy**

Predictive insights are patterns your model uncovered and a business recommendation is the next step: a practical, strategic action the team can take based on the insight.

Your role is to bridge the gap between data and action by:
- Restating the insight in clear terms
- Brainstorming possible responses
- Evaluating each option based on feasibility and impact
- Selecting one course of action
- Justifying it clearly to decision-makers

AI-powered tools can improve decision-making, but they can also introduce risks, especially in sensitive areas like credit and collections. As an AI transformation consultant, you're not only responsible for what a model predicts but also how those predictions are used and understood. Before presenting or recommending any model-driven action, it's important to consider three key areas: bias, explainability, responsible decision-making. 

The final output as a Business Summaty Report includes: 
- Summary of predictive insights.
- Recommendation framework.
- Ethical and responsible AI considerations.

**Task 4: Implementing an AI-driven collections strategy**

Your new task is to prepare a presentation outlining a framework for an AI-powered collections system that does just that. This means designing a system that uses agentic AI — systems capable of reasoning, adapting, and making autonomous decisions — to optimize and personalize customer outreach at scale. 

To achieve this, you'll need to consider:
- How the system will process model outputs and _automatically_ take action (e.g., triggering reminders, adjusting outreach cadence, escalating cases).
- Where human oversight is _essential_, and what limits or controls should be implemented on the AI's actions.
- How the system can be adaptive and self-improving — learning from new data to _continuously refine_ its decision-making.
- What safeguards are required to ensure fairness, transparency, explainability, and legal compliance throughout the system's operation.

Designing an AI-powered, autonomous debt-management system: 
- Ingest predictive risk scores (e.g., from your model in Task 2)
- Determine the best course of action (e.g., payment reminder, hardship support)
- Personalise timing and messaging based on customer behavior
- Monitor outcomes and adjust future actions accordingly

Key components of an autonomous system:
- Data pipeline: Feeds the system real-time customer information.
- Decision engine: Applies business rules and model outputs to make autonomous decisions.
- Action layer: Executes interventions.
- Learning loop: Monitors outcomes and feeds them back into the model to refine future decisions.
